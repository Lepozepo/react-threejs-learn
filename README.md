## NOTES

This is a proof of concept showing how to marry reactjs with threejs. This paradigm enables:
- Use of react lifecycles in ThreeJS components
- Atomic control of what is being rendered, how, and when
- Use of react context for key ThreeJS elements like scene
- Atomic control for animations and interactions
